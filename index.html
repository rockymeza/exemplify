    <h1>Exemplify.js, a simple demo tool</h1>

    <p>The purpose of Exemplify is to make it easier to write examples for JavaScript libraries or tools that you wish to show off. It tries to help you avoid code duplication by taking the source code of the working demo that you have and displaying the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to the user.</p>

    <h2>Examples:</h2>

      <li><a href="./examples/syntax-highlighting.html">Syntax Highlighting</a>
